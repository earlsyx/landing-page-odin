# landing-page-odin

For this project, I will be creating an entire web page from 
the odin project. 

It comes with 2 images, one is an image of the complete website, and
one has some details about some of the fonts and colors.

I'll be creating my project as close as I can with the design.

The point of this project is to create something from scratch and get
the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

I will be substituting my own content to the design.
